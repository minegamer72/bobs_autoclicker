# Bob's Simple Autoclicker
This is my replacement for OP Auto Clicker. I did this to start learning C#. 

[Source code for WindowsInput.dll](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/inputsimulator)

# Does this work with WINE?
Wayland: Clicking only works on the program window. <br>
X11: Unknown support, but if you want to use an autoclicker you should probably be using [XClicker](https://github.com/robiot/XClicker) instead.

# Will there be more support for this program?
No. I refuse to create programs for an operating system that is just straight up spyware.
